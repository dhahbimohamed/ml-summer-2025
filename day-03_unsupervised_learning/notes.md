# ðŸ“˜ Day 3: Unsupervised Learning

## ðŸ§  My Understanding (Rating: 8/10)

Unsupervised learning is the **opposite of supervised learning** â€” there are **no labels** provided with the data. Instead, the model learns to find **patterns** or **structures** on its own.

### âœ… Key Concepts:
- **Clustering**: Grouping data points based on similarity of features.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks that learn to compress (encode) and reconstruct (decode) input data. They're useful for tasks like:
  - **Noise removal in images**
  - **Dimensionality reduction**

### ðŸ§ª Example Ideas:
- Grouping users by behavior (without labeled categories)
- Denoising an image by training an autoencoder on clean + noisy image pairs
