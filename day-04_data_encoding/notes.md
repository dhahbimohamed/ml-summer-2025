# Day 4 - Data Encoding

## Label Encoding
Each category is replaced with a number.
Example: Red → 0, Blue → 1

## One-Hot Encoding
Each category becomes a column with 0 or 1.
Example:
Red, Blue, Green → [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]

## Why we use them:
ML only works with numbers. Categories must be turned into numbers first.

## My understanding: 8/10
