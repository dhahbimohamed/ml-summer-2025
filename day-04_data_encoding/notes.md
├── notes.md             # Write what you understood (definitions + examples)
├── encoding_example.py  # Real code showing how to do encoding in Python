# Day 4 – Data Encoding

## What I learned:
- Label Encoding assigns a number to each category (e.g. Red = 2, Blue = 0)
- One-Hot Encoding turns each category into a column (binary)
- Encoding is required because ML algorithms only work with numbers

## Real-life Example:
Gender: [Male, Female] → Label: [1, 0] or One-Hot: [Male=1, Female=0]
