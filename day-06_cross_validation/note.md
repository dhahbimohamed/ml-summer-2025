# 📊 Cross-Validation in Machine Learning

Cross-validation is a fundamental technique used to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models on a given dataset. It ensures that our models generalize well to unseen data and helps in selecting the best-performing model.

## 🔍 Why Use Cross-Validation?

When building machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest), it’s crucial to understand how well they perform — not just on training data, but also on new, unseen data. Cross-validation provides a more reliable estimate of model performance than a simple train/test split.

## 🧪 Common Cross-Validation Techniques

### 1. **K-Fold Cross-Validation**
- The dataset is split into *K* equal parts (folds).
- For each of the *K* iterations, one fold is used for testing, and the remaining *K−1* folds are used for training.
- The process is repeated *K* times, and the average performance is calculated.
- Common values: `K = 5` or `10`.

### 2. **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**
- A special case of K-Fold where `K = number of samples`.
- Each instance is used once as a test set while the rest form the training set.
- Ideal for **small datasets**.

### 3. **Train/Test Split (Holdout Validation)**
- The dataset is split into a fixed ratio (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
- Faster but less robust than K-Fold.

## ⚙️ Role in Model Selection

Cross-validation helps:
- Identify models with **low bias and low variance**.
- Avoid overfitting/underfitting.
- Compare models objectively on the same dataset.

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning

Many machine learning models have hyperparameters (e.g., `C` in SVM, `max_depth` in Random Forest) that need to be set before training. Cross-validation is used within:

- **Grid Search** or **Random Search**: To find the best combination of hyperparameters.
- **Nested Cross-Validation**: To prevent data leakage during hyperparameter optimization.
