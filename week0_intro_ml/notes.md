# 📘 Week 0: Introduction to Machine Learning

## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  
With the massive amount of data generated today (from the internet, sensors, etc.), ML uses this data to detect patterns and make predictions or decisions.

## 🧠 Types of Machine Learning

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- **Input:** Labeled data (features + correct output)
- **Goal:** Learn the relationship between input and output
- **Example:** Email spam detection, where emails are labeled as *spam* or *not spam*

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Input:** Unlabeled data (only features)
- **Goal:** Find hidden patterns or groupings in the data
- **Example:** Customer segmentation in marketing, where similar behavior groups are identified

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Input:** Interaction with an environment
- **Goal:** Learn by trial and error, using feedback (rewards or penalties)
- **Example:** A robot learning to walk or a game AI learning to play chess

## 📌 Summary

| Type                 | Data Input      | Output            | Example                         |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Supervised Learning  | Labeled data     | Predict labels     | Spam detection, price prediction |
| Unsupervised Learning| Unlabeled data   | Discover structure | Clustering, anomaly detection    |
| Reinforcement Learning | Feedback/rewards | Learn behavior    | Game playing, robotics           |

## 📝 Notes
- ML relies heavily on data quality and quantity.
- Algorithms like decision trees, neural networks, and clustering methods are used.
- Training a model is the process of teaching it using data.
- Evaluation measures how well the model performs (accuracy, loss, etc.).
